## Web Editor

```
NOTE: You must be running at least version 5.0.44 of LuckPerms to use this version of the web editor.
Currently there is no public release of this available and you will need to build the plugin from source.

There are no plans to support older versions of the plugin.
```

A working version can be found here:  
[https://luckperms.turbotailz.com/editor/](https://luckperms.turbotailz.com/#/editor/)`<sessionID>`

Where `<sessionID>` is the 10 digit ID when you generate a new editor session.

**Example:**

If your link looks like this:

```
https://luckperms.github.io/editor/#ewx0HjBMX9
```

Then your session ID is `ewx0HjBMX9` - the part after the `#`

## Project setup
Setting up the project locally is simple, all you need is Node installed on your computer, then you can clone the repo and run:
```
npm install
```

### Compile and setup hot-reloads for development
Once you've installed the dependencies, you can run the project locally easily by running:
```
npm run serve
```

### Compile and minify for production
If you want to build the project to a folder that can be access via a webserver, running this command will build the project in the `dist` folder:
```
npm run build
```

make sure to install to /var/www/html dir
